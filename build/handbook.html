    <p>
      There are two paid parking lots near SRYE, one behind the building to the west and one across the street to the south. 
      The south parking lot is $9 for the whole day and the west lot is $5.

    <h3>By Transit</h3>
    <p>
      SFU Surrey is conveniently located right next to Surrey Central station on the Expo Line.

      <p>Please note, hackers are not required to stay overnight! Hackers are free to leave the event whenever they like. 
      For safety, our team will enforce a strict curfew and lock campus doors from 10:00PM-7:00AM, so there will be no 
      entry during this period if you leave the premises.<br><br>
      We will have a <b>safe walk</b> at <b>10:00PM</b> to the skytrain station for anyone who is not planning to stay overnight.

  <!-- Submissions Section -->
  <section id="submissions" class="container-info">
    <h2>Submissions</h2>
    <p>
      Projects will be submitted on the XHacks Devpost. Feel free to create a devpost account if you haven't 
      and form your team now if you have teammates in mind. When the time comes, be sure to submit your project 
      there and nominate yourself for the awards you qualify for before judging begins at 1:00pm on Sunday. 
      Also be sure to check out other people’s submissions and vote on your favourite for the People’s Choice Award.

  <!-- Mini Events Section -->
  <section id="mini-events" class="container-info">
    <h2>Mini Events</h2>
    <p>
      Not sure you’ll be able to focus non-stop for 24 straight hours? Not to worry, we’ll have mini events 
      throughout the day for you to take a breather!
    </p><br>
    <p>
      We’ll have a station for both speed-typing and trivia, where you’ll be competing for a spot on the 
      leaderboard. Keep an eye out on the Discord announcements for these events (and potentially some extra surprises)!
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Teams Section -->
  <section id="teams" class="container-info">
    <h2>Teams</h2>
    <p>You must be in a team of 2-4 to participate in the hackathon. If you don’t have a team yet, don’t worry! We have
      two options.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Checking out the <code class="code">#find-a-team</code> forum on the XHacks Discord</li>
      <li>After the opening ceremonies the day of, hackers without a team can stay in the room and form teams.</li>
    </ol><br>
    <p>
      We encourage you to form teams of 4 as it increases the amount of collaboration and fun when making a project. If
      you already are in a team of 3, consider taking in someone who doesn’t have a team! They will appreciate it.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      A form will go out in the evening for you to submit your team name and members. This allows for us to get an idea of
      how many submissions we have and start making the judging schedule.

  </section>

  <!-- Communication Section -->
  <section id="communication" class="container-info">
    <h2>Communication</h2>
    <p>Our main method of communication will be the <b>XHacks Discord server</b>, which you will have received a
      link to after RSVPing for XHacks. Here is where you will get the most up-to-date information on the hackathon, along
      with channels to introduce yourself, learn about the mentors, and form teams with others.</p><br>
    <p>Be sure to leave your notifications on for mentions during the event as this will be how we will send reminders
      and deliver important information for the day of the hackathon.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Hacking Locations Section -->
  <section id="hacking-locations" class="container-info">
    <h2>Hacking Place</h2>
    <p>
      The two main hacking locations will be SRYE 3016 and SRYE 4016. These locations will have outlets + extension
      cords and will also be where most mentors will be hovering around to give any assistance. There are also the stairs and tree
      pods through the building which have outlets underneath their utility covers which can be used.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      The campus is still open to the public so we ask you to be mindful of the non-hacking students that may be
      studying for exams. This is especially true in SRYE 3006 which is considered the silent solo studying room, please
      do not have your team discussions there as someone may be trying to study in peace.
    </p><br>
    <p>A map of the SRYE building can be found <a href=" https://www.sfu.ca/information-systems/services/computer-labs/surrey/surrey-e-labs/srye-1000-level.html">here</a>.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Lost and Found Section -->
  <section id="lost-and-found" class="container-info">
    <h2>Lost and Found</h2>
    <p>
      The check-in table at the entrance of the building will be where lost items will be kept. If you’ve lost
      something, send a message to the <code class="code">#lost-and-found</code> channel on the XHacks Discord to let everyone know. If you’ve
      found something, give it to an organizer or drop it off at the check-in table.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Presentations and Judging Section -->
  <section id="presentations-and-judging" class="container-info">
    <h2>Presentations and Judging</h2>
    <p>
      The judging schedule will be released at 10:00AM before brunch and will start at 1:00PM. Judging will take place in 
      the two hacking rooms, SRYE 3016 and SRYE 4016, in front of a panel of judges. You will be given 3 minutes to 
      present and then the panel will ask you some questions. You will only be eligible for an award if you present. 
      HDMI and USB-C cables will be provided for you to plug in your device for presenting.
    </p><br>
    <h3>Here are some presentation tips:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Don’t overdo it! Don’t make slides, graphics, or anything fancy for your presentation. Plug your laptop
        into the projector and show off your project in action! With only 3 minutes, what's most important is the
        project itself.</li>
      <li>Relax! The judges are there to learn more about your project and ask questions. For many participants it may
        be their first time presenting at a hackathon and everyone understands that. The stakes could not be any lower.
      </li>
      <li>Be confident! You spent a whole day working on a project and you should be proud of that! No matter what state
        your project may be in, it's always cathartic to give a presentation at the end of the hackathon. 
        No matter what you have, you can find something to talk about.
        Program doesn’t compile? Talk about your process! Didn’t achieve your initial goals? Talk about how you came up
        with the idea and how you plan on working on it in the future.</li><br>
    </ul>
    <p>Feel free to watch other hackers present and congratulate them for their accomplishments! It’s also a great way
      to know who you’ll vote for in the People’s Choice award. Please keep conversation to a minimum while watching as
      to not make the judging rooms too noisy for the judges to hear the presenters.</p>
