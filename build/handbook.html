    <h2>Check-in</h2>
    <p>Accepted hackers should have received an email with a link to their ticket. At the bottom, click on the button
      to view the QR code. We will be scanning those on the day of to check you in as well as checking a piece of your
      photo ID!</p>

  </section>

  <!-- Submissions Section -->
  <section id="submissions" class="container-info">
    <h2>Submissions</h2>
    <p>Projects will be submitted on the DreamHacks Devpost. Feel free to create your account and form your team now if
      you have one already. Be sure to submit your project there and nominate yourself for the awards you qualify for
      before judging begins at 7:00pm. Also be sure to check out other people’s submissions and vote on your favourite
      for the People’s Choice Award.</p>
  </section>


  <!-- TODO: UPDATE MINI EVENTS -->
  <!-- Mini Events Section -->
  <section id="mini-events" class="container-info">
    <h2>Mini Events</h2>
    <p>Not sure you’ll be able to focus non-stop for 10 straight hours? Not to worry, we’ll have mini events throughout
      the day for you to take a breather!</p>
    <p>We’ll have a station for both speed-typing and cupstacking, where you’ll be competing for a spot on the
      leaderboard. Additionally, before the award ceremony, we’ll put everyone into a round of trivia. Keep an eye out
      on the Discord announcements for these events (and potentially some extra surprises)!</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Teams Section -->
  <section id="teams" class="container-info">
    <h2>Teams</h2>
    <p>You must be in a team of 2-4 to participate in the hackathon. If you don’t have a team yet, don’t worry! We have
      two options.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Checking out the #find-a-team forum on the DreamHacks Discord</li>
      <li>After the opening ceremonies the day of, hackers without a team can stay in the room and form teams.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We encourage you to form teams of 4 as it increases the amount of collaboration and fun when making a project. If
      you already are in a team of 3, consider taking in someone who doesn’t have a team! They will appreciate it.</p>
    <p>At lunch a form will go out for you to submit your team name and members. This allows for us to get an idea of
      how many submissions we have and start making the judging schedule.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Meals Section -->
  <!-- TODO: UPDATE MEALS -->
  <section id="meals" class="container-info">
    <h2>Meals</h2>
    <p>DreamHacks will have 3 meals throughout the day. Food details are subject to change.</p>
    <h3>Breakfast - 9:00am to 10:00am</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You shall know soon</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>You shall know soon</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let us know if you have any dietary concerns with the menu and we’ll figure something out together!</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Communication Section -->
  <section id="communication" class="container-info">
    <h2>Communication</h2>
    <p>Our main method of communications will be the <b>DreamHacks Discord server</b>, which you will have received a
      link to
      after RSVPing for DreamHacks. Here is where you will get the most up-to-date information on the hackathon, along
      with channels to introduce yourself, learn about the mentors, and form teams with others.</p>
    <p>Be sure to leave your notifications on for mentions during the event as this will be how we will send reminders
      and deliver important information for the day of the hackathon.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Hacking Locations Section -->
  <section id="hacking-locations" class="container-info">
    <h2>Hacking Place</h2>
    <p>The two main hacking locations will be SRYE 3016 and SRYE 4016. These locations will have outlets + extension
      cords and where most mentors will be hovering around to give any assistance. There are also the stairs and tree
      pods through the building which have outlets underneath their utility covers which can be used.</p>
    <p>The campus is still open to the public so we ask you to be mindful of the non-hacking students that may be
      studying for exams. This is especially true in SRYE 3006 which is considered the silent solo studying room, please
      do not have your team discussions there as someone may be trying to study in peace.</p>
    <p>A map of the SRYE building can be found <a href=" https://www.sfu.ca/see/building/maps.html">here</a>.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Lost and Found Section -->
  <section id="lost-and-found" class="container-info">
    <h2>Lost and Found</h2>
    <p>The check-in table at the entrance of the building will be where lost items will be kept. If you’ve lost
      something, send a message to the #lost-and-found channel on the DreamHacks Discord to let everyone know. If you’ve
      found something, give it to an organizer (in a purple shirt) or drop it off at the check-in table.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Presentations and Judging Section -->
  <section id="presentations-and-judging" class="container-info">
    <h2>Presentations and Judging</h2>
    <p>The judging schedule will be released at 5:00pm during dinner and will start at 7:00pm. Judging will take place
      in the two hacking rooms, SRYE 3016 and SRYE 4016, in front of a panel of judges. You will be given 3 minutes to
      present and then the panel will ask you some questions. You will only be eligible for an award if you present.
      HDMI and USB-C cables will be provided for you to plug in your device for presenting.</p>
    <h3>Here are some presentation tips:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Don’t overdo it! Don’t make slides, graphics, or anything fancy for your presentation. Plug in your laptop
        into the projector and show off your project in action! With only 3 minutes, what's most important is the
        project itself.</li>
      <li>Relax! The judges are there to learn more about your project and ask questions. For many participants it may
        be their first time presenting at a hackathon and everyone understands that. The stakes could not be any lower.
      </li>
      <li>Be confident! You spent a whole day working on a project and you should be proud of that! No matter what state
        your project may be in, it's always cathartic to
        ive a presentation at the end of the hackathon. No matter what you have, you can find something to talk about.
        Program doesn’t compile? Talk about your process! Didn’t achieve your initial goals? Talk about how you came up
        with the idea and how you plan on working on it in the future.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Feel free to watch other hackers present and congratulate them for their accomplishments! It’s also a great way
      to know who you’ll vote for in the People’s Choice award. Please keep conversation to a minimum while watching as
      to not make the judging rooms too noisy for the judges to hear the presenters.</p>

  <!-- What to Bring Section -->
  <section id="what-to-bring" class="container-info">

    <ul>
